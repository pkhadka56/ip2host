# domain2servername

One server can have more than one ip. Each ip can have multiple domains. In this situation we can't remember each ip and the server hostname of website which it belongs to. Therefore this simple python script will look for ip address then will output the server name.

# Run
$ python domain2servername.py domainname.com
